# TODO(aoeu): This GRUB_DEFAULT value was originall set to 0,
# but was hardcoded to use kernel 4.18.0-10 when, after installing docker,
# kernel 4.18.0-16 was transiently installed and results in booting to
# initramfs because the encryption kernel modules and some lvm2 functionality
# is strangely absent when booting with 4.18.0-16. Remove this hardcoding if
# the issues with 4.18.0-16 are ever resolved.
# Value for kernel obtain by:
# $ grep gnulinux /boot/grub/grub.cfg | grep 0-10 | grep -v recovery | \
#	sed -e 's/^.*menuentry_id_option //' -e 's/ {$//'
